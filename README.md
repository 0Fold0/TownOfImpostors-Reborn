# New Classes and Abilities?
## Sheriff
The Sheriff is a class that has the ability to kill Impostors. However, if they attempt to kill a fellow crewmate, they will lose their own life instead as a punishment.

## Doctor
The Doctor is a class that has the ability to revive dead players. However, this means they are also able to revive Impostors that have been killed by the Sheriff.

## Impostor
The Impostor has additional abilities they can make use of:
- **Drag & Drop Bodies** - Impostors can drag around and drop dead bodies to reposition them. They may also drag bodies through vents.
- **Dispose Bodies** - Impostors can dispose a body they are dragging if they are close to a vent or inside the vents.
- **Disguise** - Impostors can disguise as another player for set duration. They must first sample the DNA of a player by being nearby the player.

# Q&A
 
### Can you play Proximity Chat (Crewlink) with it?
Yes, Crewlink supports Among Us Modifications

### Can you get banned for playing on public Servers?
At the current state of the game there is no perma ban system for the game. The mod is designed in a way, that it does not send prohibited server requests.
You are also able to join your own custom server to be safe <a href="https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor">(Impostor)</a></p>

### How can I join a custom server?
Go to your game directory and open BepInEx/config/org.bepinex.plugins.TownOfImpostors.txt. There you can set the hostname or IP of the server. Then set the server region to CUSTOM.

### Do my friends need to install the mod to play it together?
Yes. Every player in the lobby must have the mod installed.
