# New Roles and Abilities?
## Sheriff
The Sheriff is a role that has the ability to kill Impostors. However, if they attempt to kill a fellow crewmate, they will lose their own life instead as a punishment.

## Doctor
The Doctor is a role that has the ability to revive dead players. However, this means they are also able to revive Impostors that have been killed by the Sheriff.

## Jester
The Jester is a role with no abilities and no tasks to do (they get fake tasks like Impostors). They are in their own team, and their goal is to get themselves ejected from the ship and make sure not to get killed by the Impostors. They will win instantly if ejected from the ship. However, if they are killed, they will have no way to win and essentially lose.

## Agent
The Agent is a powerful role that has abilities allowing them to access map intel from anywhere. This includes the admin table map, security cameras, door logs and vitals if any are accessible. This gives them much more information on what is going on around the map, but they shouldn't neglect their tasks either.

## Detective
The Detective is a role that can see footprints and get extra information when reporting bodies (They will get a body report in chat only they can see, which shows time of death and if the body was moved or not). They should use this ability to track down Impostors, but they should also be careful not to frame the wrong person.

## Plumber
The Plumber is a role that can use vents to travel around. They can also stay in vents to observe the room. But they should be careful not to be suspected as the Impostor or noticed by the Impostor.

## Arsonist
The Arsonist is a role that aims to douse everyone alive and igniting them all to win alone. They have no tasks (they get fake tasks like Impostors), but should be careful not to be suspected as they have to say close for the duration of time they are dousing. They should also be careful not to be killed by the Impostor.

## Impostor
The Impostor has additional abilities they can make use of:
- **Drag & Drop Bodies** - Impostors can drag around and drop dead bodies to reposition them. They may also drag bodies through vents.
- **Dispose Bodies** - Impostors can dispose a body they are dragging if they are close to a vent or inside the vents. But when bodies are disposed, a bloodstain is left behind on the vent to give crewmates a clue.
- **Disguise** - Impostors can disguise as another player for set duration. They must first sample the DNA of a player by being nearby the player.


# How does role assignment work?
When adding in any roles (the count or enabling Jester/Arsonist, as there can only be one Jester and Arsonist maximum), they are all added to a pool and assigned out to players at random. A player is always assigned a role as long as there's a role in the pool to be assigned, otherwise they are just given crewmate.

<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>

- Download the Mod for your specific game version. You are not able to launch the game if the versions do not match.
- Make a copy of your gameâ€™s root directory ("Steam/steamapps/common/Among Us"). You can get to your root directory by right-clicking Among Us in steam -> Properties -> Local Files -> Browse. and rename it to whatever you want (e.g. "Steam/steamapps/common/Among Us Town Of Impostors")
- Extract the contents TownOfImpostors.zip into the copied folder you created
- **Make sure to launch the game via Among Us.exe**
- Please note that the first time launching the game with this mod may take a while

**There is a new reset custom settings button in the lobby. Please use it if your settings are bugged. Settings can bug when you update from version to version, it's best practice to reset settings.**

**If you do not follow the installation instructions exactly, or you use a Mod Manager or other mods with this mod, I cannot guarantee the mod will work as intended. Please only raise issues if you've followed installations exactly and you are not using any mod manager or other mods.**

**When updating from version to version, settings can bug and cause unintended effects. This is due to how new custom settings are being added in each update. If you are getting strange bugs occurring with the settings, try manually settings everything again (to overwrite the saved settings on your computer) by manually toggling options on and off, setting timers and settings counts. You can also do a hard reset by running vanilla among us and creating a lobby, then reopening among us with this mod.**

**Verifying installation success**
- Launch the game via Among Us.exe
- In the top-left corner, below Among Us version, you should see _Town Of Impostors vX.X.X Mod by AJMix_

# Q&A
 
### Can you play Proximity Chat (Crewlink) with it?
Yes, Crewlink supports Among Us Modifications

### Can you get banned for playing on public Servers?
At the current state of the game there is no perma ban system for the game. The mod is designed in a way, that it does not send prohibited server requests.
You are also able to join your own custom server to be safe <a href="https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor">(Impostor)</a></p>

### How can I join a custom server?
Go to your game directory and open BepInEx/config/com.ajmix.townofimpostors.txt. There you can set the hostname or IP of the server. Then set the server region to CUSTOM.

### Do my friends need to install the mod to play it together?
Yes. Every player in the lobby must have the mod installed. Please don't use and play mods in unorganised public lobbies.

### Can this mod work with other mods?
I cannot guarantee that this mod will work with other mods. There will likely be conflicts. You will have to test yourself.

<h1 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h1>

### The mod isn't installed or game doesn't launch
- Please make sure you're using the latest version of the mod and the correct version of Among Us for it
- Make sure you have followed all the <a href="#installation">installation steps</a>, especially launching the game via the Among Us.exe file
- You might be missing some cpp libs (software libraries used by the mod); please install <a href="https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe">visual studio c++</a>

### I can't find my issue
You can <a href="https://github.com/AJMix/TownOfImpostors/issues/new">raise an issue within GitHub</a> documenting your issue. You will need to be logged into GitHub to do this.

## Known Issues
- When updating from version to version, settings can bug and cause unintended effects. This is due to how new custom settings are being added in each update. If you are getting strange bugs occurring with the settings, try manually settings everything again (to overwrite the saved settings on your computer) by manually toggling options on and off, setting timers and settings counts. You can also do a hard reset by running vanilla among us and creating a lobby, then reopening among us with this mod. In v1.5.0 onwards, there is a new reset settings button the host can make use of to do a hard reset on all custom settings to reset everything to default values
- Disconnections in the middle of the game can cause bugs to occur, and the only way to fix them would be starting a new game or restarting the game. This mod was made with the assumption that no one would disconnect as disconnections are a whole other edgecase to fix. Future updates will hopefully fix this, but for now, just start another game or restart the client if a disconnection causes your game to bug
- There's currently a strange bug that has a low chance of occurring, sometimes the Agent buttons will bug out. Not sure what's currently causing it, but it should only bug out once and should be fine in games after
