### Lovers

# How does role assignment work?
The role selection works as follows:
For each role, it will attempt to add that to the selection pool **X** number of times, where **X** is the maximum count. The chance of the role being added to the selection pool each time is based on the percentage chance set in the custom options for the specified role.

Once the selection pool is filled, the roles in there will then be randomly assigned to Crewmates (who are not already Impostors and don't already have a special role). As long as there are roles in the pool to assign and Crewmates to assign them to, they will be assigned out. If there are no more roles to be assigned out, the remaining players will just stay as normal Crewmates.

Example:
_**Sheriffs - # Max Count: 3 | % Chance: 50**_

This means that the role selection will try to put 3 sheriffs into the pool, at 50% chance each time. So the pool can end up with 0, 1, 2 or even the maximum of 3 Sheriffs.

- Try uninstalling the mod (see uninstalling the mod in the Installation Steps) and following the installation steps again
- If you're using a Mod Manager to install the mod, it is not guaranteed to work

If it exists, please also attach your **LogOutput.log**, generated in the Among Us\BepInEx\ folder.

## Known Issues
- When updating from version to version, settings can bug and cause unintended effects. This is due to how new custom settings are being added in each update. If you are getting strange bugs occurring with the settings, try manually settings everything again (to overwrite the saved settings on your computer) by manually toggling options on and off, setting timers and settings counts. You can also do a hard reset by running vanilla among us and creating a lobby, then reopening among us with this mod. In v1.5.0 onwards, there is a new reset settings button the host can make use of to do a hard reset on all custom settings to reset everything to default values

- Disconnections in the middle of the game can cause bugs to occur, and the only way to fix them would be starting a new game or restarting the game. This mod was made with the assumption that no one would disconnect as disconnections are a whole other edgecase to fix. Future updates will hopefully fix this, but for now, just start another game or restart the client if a disconnection causes your game to bug
